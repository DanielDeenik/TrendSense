## Critical Limitations

### ❌ Data Reliability Issues

**Mock Data Dependency:**
```python
# From codebase analysis - hardcoded fallback values
"environmental_impact": 75,
"market_potential": 70,
"esg_score": round((env_scores[-1] + social_scores[-1] + gov_scores[-1]) / 3, 2)
```

**Impact**: Platform generates placeholder metrics when real data is unavailable, undermining investment decision reliability.

**Required**: Integration with established ESG data providers (Bloomberg ESG, Refinitiv, MSCI ESG).

### ❌ Analytical Sophistication

**Simplistic Scoring:**
```python
# Basic attractiveness calculation
attractiveness_map = {"High": 3, "Medium": 2, "Low": 1}
```

**Impact**: Investment-grade analysis requires sophisticated quantitative models, not basic categorical scoring.

**Required**: Advanced statistical models, time-series analysis, predictive algorithms.

### ❌ Regulatory Compliance Gap

**Limited Framework Implementation:**
- Basic SDG tagging without comprehensive alignment metrics
- No evidence of detailed CSRD/SFDR compliance mapping
- Missing regulatory reporting templates and validation

**Impact**: Institutional investors require verified compliance capabilities for regulatory adherence.

**Required**: Comprehensive regulatory framework with audit trails and compliance validation.

### ❌ Data Source Integration

**Current Limitations:**
- No direct connections to premium ESG data providers
- Limited PDF parsing capabilities despite marketing claims
- No real-time data feeds from regulatory portals

**Impact**: Platform cannot provide institutional-grade data coverage and timeliness.

**Required**: Premium data partnerships and real-time integration capabilities.
